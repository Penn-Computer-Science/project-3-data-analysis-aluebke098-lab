## Data Analysis & Insights
Write a short analysis of your findings. Include at least one interesting insight from your data.

> The average hours of sleep was 7, the average hours of screentime was 5, and the average GPA was 3. However, I don't really think that this data is terribly accurate because
the majority of the data was generated junk data.

## Reflection
Answer briefly:
- What went well in your project? 
mostly everything
- What was the most challenging part?
um probably finding questions, although I don't really think that these ones are that good.
- If you had more time, what would you do differently?
not sure, maybe make the graphs look a bit prettier?
